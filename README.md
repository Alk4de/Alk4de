- Hi, My name is Alexander, or [@Dirivial](https://dirivial.dev/)
- I am interested in programming, technology, reading, climbing, and weightlifting.
- What I am learning is constantly changing, but I often find myself reverting to webdev, gamedev and/or clistuff.
- You can reach me @ Alexander.Kadeby@gmail.com
